### To run ContentShell and collect simpleperf stats
---

adb push speedometer2.0_meerkat /data/local/tmp/speedometer2.0_meerkat

1. Start ContentShell and load the url benchmarks/speedometer/Speedometer_profile/InteractiveRunnerIters.html

sh /data/local/tmp/speedometer2.0_meerkat/run_speed_index.sh /data/local/tmp/speedometer2.0_meerkat/env_meerkat_setup_numbig_v01.sh 0x10 400

env_meerkat_setup_numbig_v01.sh runs 1 little core and 1 big core
* Runs the big core at frequency 2.1GHz
* Disables cstate
* Disables DTM
* Disables thermal management

2. Go to Iters text box and increase the iters to 1000 ( a high value) and select ReactTodoMVC and hit Run button.

3. Push the necessary automation script into device.
adb push run_simpleperf_stats.sh /data/local/tmp

4. Issue from target (Android device) below command to collect perf stat
sh -x /data/local/tmp/run_simpleperf_stats.sh

This collects 14 hardware cache events, 7 hardware events, 44 raw PMU events,
and 9 SW events and combine them into a single stat file.

5. Post process using the Excel file attached to the following JIRA: http://jira.spa.sarc.samsung.com/browse/WOR-3671


### To run ContentShell and collect simpleperf record and report
---

1. adb push $(pwd)/run_speedometer_record.sh /data/local/tmp

2. Start the python server from this location:
  cd benchmarks/speedometer/Speedometer2.0_from_browserbench.org_April-11-2018/Speedometer2.0
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8082

  adb reverse tcp:8082 tcp:8082

3. Issue below command from target (Android device) to start recording.
  sh -x run_speedometer_record.sh Sub 1 (To record individual suite for sandbox process)
  sh -x run_speedometer_record.sh All 1 (To record full suite for sandbox process)

  sh -x run_speedometer_record.sh Sub 0 (To record individual suite for CrRenderer thread)
  sh -x run_speedometer_record.sh All 0 (To record full suite for CrRenderer thread)

4. Issue below command from host for post processing perf.data. This will generate perf report.
Perf annotate is commented out since it is taking too long a time to complete. Change the necessary
global variables in the script to match your chromium build directory.

  bash -x $(pwd)/postprocess_simpleperf_record.sh Sub 1 (To report individual suite for sandbox process)
  bash -x $(pwd)/postprocess_simpleperf_record.sh All 1 (To report full suite for sandbox process)

  bash -x $(pwd)/postprocess_simpleperf_record.sh Sub 0 (To report individual suite for CrRenderer thread)
  bash -x $(pwd)/postprocess_simpleperf_record.sh All 0 (To report full suite for CrRenderer thread)
